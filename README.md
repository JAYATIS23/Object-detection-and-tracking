# Object-detection-and-tracking
This project implements an AI-based traffic monitoring system using YOLOv8 and computer vision to analyze traffic videos in real time. The system detects and tracks multiple vehicle types, estimates vehicle speed, identifies overspeeding vehicles, and computes lane-wise traffic density from a single video feed.
